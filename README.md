Speeduino in rust, this is forked from another fork that included simple als/rotational idle settings.

actual upstream is https://github.com/noisymime/speeduino

https://github.com/AKCore/speeduino for als stuff
"Basic anti-lag and rotational idle added. Both tested to work, Rotational idle is not cutting enough events though."
